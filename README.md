3. Why do you want to join technocolabs as ML intern
4. Say you scrap the data from different sources about funding loans, and you found number of null rows, what will you do. Say the null values were 50% or less, how about 80% and above, how can we deal with these null values?
6. How can we convert numerical data to categorcal data and vice virca
7. How can we find a correlationship 
8. How can we deal with outliers
9. What is features engineering
10. What supervised ML algorithms do you know


Then we speaks about the internship process:

## Internship process 

Technocolabs is a multinational company that takes data from number of diffrent sources, and apply data analysis and machine learning models to 
the data of the customers, then they apply these findings into their web and mobile app business. The interns will be monitored by the company's project manager and mentor.

## Internship tasks

### Data scraping
There will be data scraping from different sources, using ADE which stands for Automated Data Extraction. It is a process or technique that involves using software or other automated means to extract data from a variety of sources, such as websites, documents, or databases. Automated data extraction can be used to quickly and accurately gather large amounts of data, which can then be used for a variety of purposes, such as data analysis, data visualization, or machine learning.
