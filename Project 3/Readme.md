This project is a collaboration between our team that worked on developing a machine learning model using Gradient Boosting and VSM (Vector Space Model). We aimed to achieve the highest accuracy in our model by comparing our data and performing different EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) techniques on our target variable.

We started by analyzing three different datasets, each with its own set of features and target variables. Ashis's data had 36 columns, Chebrolu's had 27 columns, and my data had 14 columns. We performed Gradient Boosting and SVM on each dataset and compared the accuracy of our models.

After a thorough analysis, we found that my data had the highest accuracy in the Gradient Boosting model with a value of 1.0, while Chebrolu's accuracy was 0.1 and Ashis's accuracy was 0.6. In the SVM model, my data had an accuracy of 0.47. Based on these results, we decided to use my data for our final model, as it had the most accurate results in the Gradient Boosting model.

Here is a breakdown of the roles and responsibilities of each team member:


| Team member name         | Role and Tasks|
| :-------------: | :-------------: |
| Fatimah | Data preprocessing feature engineering and modeling |
| Chebrolu | Data cleaning and preprocessing, and feature engineering  |
| Ashish | Data preprocessing, feature engineering and modeling |
| Asif | Data analysis and preprocessing |
| Mohamed | Data analysis and preprocessing |
